## Data Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps were performed:
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas
- Checked data types and dataset structure
- Handled missing values (removed or cleaned where necessary)
- Converted columns like Year, Runtime, and Ratings to appropriate data types
- Cleaned and standardized categorical columns such as Genre

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was carried out to understand the dataset and identify patterns:
- Distribution of IMDB ratings
- Number of movies released per year
- Most common movie genres
- Relationship between ratings and number of votes
- Top highest-rated movies

Visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to support analysis.

## Key Insights
- The average IMDB rating of top movies is relatively high, indicating strong audience preference.
- Drama is the most common genre among top-rated movies.
- Movies with higher vote counts generally tend to have higher ratings.
- Certain years show a higher concentration of top-rated movie releases.
